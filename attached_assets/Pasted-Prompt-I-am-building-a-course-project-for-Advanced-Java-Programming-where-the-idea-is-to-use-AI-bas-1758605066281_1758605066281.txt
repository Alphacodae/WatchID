Prompt

I am building a course project for Advanced Java Programming where the idea is to use AI-based face + age detection for content management (for example, blocking restricted movies based on user’s age).

For my first review, I only need a frontend Angular web app (no real AI integration yet). The goal is to simulate the process of movie selection and face verification.

Please generate a complete Angular codebase with the following requirements:

Tech stack

Angular (latest stable, CLI generated project).

Bootstrap for styling (CDN link is fine).

No backend required at this stage (use mock services / client-side state).

Features

Landing page showing multiple movie cards in a grid. Each card has:

Movie title

Poster image

Age restriction (e.g., 0+, 13+, 18+)

"Watch" button

Clicking on any card should redirect to a Face Verification page:

Show movie title + required age.

Provide two verification modes:

Webcam capture (use navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia, but processing is simulated).

Quick simulation buttons: e.g., "Simulate Adult (25)", "Simulate Teen (15)", "Simulate Child (10)".

After pressing "Verify", simulate AI processing (loading spinner for ~1–2s).

Display result:

"Access Granted" if detected/simulated age ≥ required age.

"Access Denied" otherwise.

Add an Admin page (simple route) where the age restriction of movies can be edited (in-memory only).

Structure

Use Angular routing (/ for movie list, /verify/:id for verification, /admin for admin).

Components: MovieList, MovieCard, Verify, Admin.

Service: MovieService (mock in-memory data).

Model: Movie { id, title, posterUrl, ageLimit, description }.

UI expectations

Use Bootstrap cards for movies.

Hover effect on movie posters.

Verification page should clearly show simulated results.

Admin page should allow editing movie age restrictions via inline input.

Extensibility

Clearly mark in code where I can later replace the simulated verification with a backend API call (e.g., Spring Boot + Python OpenCV model).

Please generate:

All Angular source files (app.module.ts, routing, components, services, models).

Include example movie posters (use Unsplash URLs or placeholders).

A ready-to-run project I can ng serve.

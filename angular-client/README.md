# Angular Client (scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal Angular app scaffold created as a starting point for migrating the existing React components into Angular.

What was created
- Basic Angular project files (package.json, tsconfig)
- Minimal `AppComponent`
- Ported components: Header, HeroSection, MovieGrid, MovieCard (simple versions)

How to run
1. Open a terminal in this folder:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\gyana\ADV Java Programming 5th sem only\WatchID - ADV Java Project\IntelliStudy\angular-client"
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server (requires `@angular/cli`):

```powershell
npm start
```

Notes and next steps
- This is a lightweight scaffold — styles and advanced features (routing, DI services, API integration, Tailwind setup) are not migrated automatically.
- After verifying the scaffold, we can iteratively migrate pages, services, and global styles.
